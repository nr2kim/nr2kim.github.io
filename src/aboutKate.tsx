                        Q. Why did you choose computer engineering as your major?
                        <div className='subSectionBodySubCategoryA'>
                            A. I've learned about computer from when I was young and also played a lot of games.
                            <br />&emsp;&emsp;
                                I always wished to become an engineer who can provide another person a new world!
                            <br />&emsp;&emsp;
                                I am proud that I am on the way to accomplish my dream.
